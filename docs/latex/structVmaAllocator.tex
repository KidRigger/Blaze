Represents main object of this library initialized.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$vk\+\_\+mem\+\_\+alloc.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Represents main object of this library initialized. 

Fill structure \hyperlink{structVmaAllocatorCreateInfo}{Vma\+Allocator\+Create\+Info} and call function vma\+Create\+Allocator() to create it. Call function vma\+Destroy\+Allocator() to destroy it.

It is recommended to create just one object of this type per {\ttfamily Vk\+Device} object, right after Vulkan is initialized and keep it alive until before Vulkan device is destroyed. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
