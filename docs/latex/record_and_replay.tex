While using the library, sequence of calls to its functions together with their parameters can be recorded to a file and later replayed using standalone player application. It can be useful to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Test correctness -\/ check if same sequence of calls will not cause crash or failures on a target platform.
\item Gather statistics -\/ see number of allocations, peak memory usage, number of calls etc.
\item Benchmark performance -\/ see how much time it takes to replay the whole sequence.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{record_and_replay_record_and_replay_usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{record_and_replay_record_and_replay_usage}
Recording functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, define following macro before every include of this library\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define VMA\_RECORDING\_ENABLED 1}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries To record sequence of calls to a file\+:} Fill in \hyperlink{structVmaAllocatorCreateInfo_ace2aa4877b16a42b0b7673d4e26000ee}{Vma\+Allocator\+Create\+Info\+::p\+Record\+Settings} member while creating \hyperlink{structVmaAllocator}{Vma\+Allocator} object. File is opened and written during whole lifetime of the allocator.

{\bfseries To replay file\+:} Use Vma\+Replay -\/ standalone command-\/line program. Precompiled binary can be found in \char`\"{}bin\char`\"{} directory. Its source can be found in \char`\"{}src/\+Vma\+Replay\char`\"{} directory. Its project is generated by Premake. Command line syntax is printed when the program is launched without parameters. Basic usage\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}VmaReplay.exe MyRecording.csv
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries Documentation of file format} can be found in file\+: \char`\"{}docs/\+Recording file format.\+md\char`\"{}. It\textquotesingle{}s a human-\/readable, text file in C\+SV format (Comma Separated Values).\hypertarget{record_and_replay_record_and_replay_additional_considerations}{}\section{Additional considerations}\label{record_and_replay_record_and_replay_additional_considerations}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Replaying file that was recorded on a different G\+PU (with different parameters like {\ttfamily buffer\+Image\+Granularity}, {\ttfamily non\+Coherent\+Atom\+Size}, and especially different set of memory heaps and types) may give different performance and memory usage results, as well as issue some warnings and errors.
\item Current implementation of recording in V\+MA, as well as Vma\+Replay application, is coded and tested only on Windows. Inclusion of recording code is driven by {\ttfamily V\+M\+A\+\_\+\+R\+E\+C\+O\+R\+D\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+ED} macro. Support for other platforms should be easy to add. Contributions are welcomed.
